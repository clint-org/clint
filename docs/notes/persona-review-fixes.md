# Combined fix work-order — persona review + UI review

Single source of truth for the remaining fix stream. Merges two independent reviews of the live app, both run 2026-06-12 to 2026-06-15, code locations verified against `develop`:

- **Persona walkthrough** (`P1`–`P4` below): two cold personas (Stout MD tenant-owner, daily CI analyst space-editor) drove the real app via Playwright with no source access. Findings in *both* sessions are load-bearing.
- **UI design review** (`UI-N` items): screen-by-screen design/interaction/consistency/a11y pass of dev.clintapp.com. Full archive with screenshots in `docs/notes/ui-review-2026-06-12.md`; screenshots in `/tmp/clint-ui-review/`.

Status legend: `[ ]` open · `[x]` fixed · `[~]` partial · `[-]` won't fix / by design.

Verification commands at the bottom. Pair a Vitest/integration spec with every task that ships behavior (house rule — no deferred test phase).

## Already shipped this session (on `develop`) — do not redo

These UI-review items are done, deployed to dev, and verified in-browser. Detail + commits in `ui-review-2026-06-12.md`.

- `[x]` **UI-1** Landscape filter bar wraps instead of clipping (`landscape-filter-bar.component.html`).
- `[x]` **UI-2** Timeline marker date captions decollide per row, 38px greedy gap (`marker-label-layout.ts`). *See P3.3 — persona found a residual "Majun2626" case to re-verify.*
- `[x]` **UI-3** Import guard awaits `SpaceRoleService.ensureRole()` instead of racing the role fetch.
- `[x]` **UI-4 / UI-5** Timeline small-text WCAG AA: marker captions darken to 4.5:1 via `textColorOnWhite()`; slate-400 meaningful labels bumped; legend strip fixed.
- `[x]` **UI-6** Disabled solid buttons neutralize to slate (was Aura's reduced-opacity brand hue reading as a different enabled color).
- `[x]` **UI-7** Engagement resolves to the Intelligence section + tab; audit-log title in topbar; trial-detail anchor-link affordance.
- `[x]` **UI-8** "Clear filters" renders only when filters are active (shared grid toolbar).
- `[x]` **UI-9** Future Catalysts: PROJECTED is quiet text, green CONFIRMED pill marks exceptions.
- `[x]` **UI-11** Status tag: red tone for terminated/withdrawn; active tone → brand tokens (whitelabel-safe).
- `[x]` **UI-17 (color half)** Role badges use brand tone, not hard-coded teal. *Treatment mismatch still open — see UI-17 below.*
- `[x]` **UI-25** Command-palette "PhPhase 3" → phase label from `phase_type` (`search_palette` migration + integration tests).

## P1 — Converged / blocking (both personas, or load-bearing)

### P1.1 — Export is the most valuable feature and hard to find
Both personas. MD found it by blind-clicking; analyst (literal task "produce something for Friday's deck") searched the palette for "export" (0 results), checked all four views, abandoned the task.

**Corrected against code (ghosts removed):**
- ~~Icon-only trigger with no accessible name~~ → **already fixed.** The shared `<app-export-button>` (`shared/export/export-button.component.ts`) renders a visible "Export" label + `fa-file-arrow-down` icon + `aria-label`. No change needed.
- ~~Extend export to Bullseye / Future Catalysts~~ → **already present.** Bullseye (export host), Heatmap, and Catalysts (grid export) all expose export. No change needed.

**Genuinely open:**
- `[x]` **Palette entry for export.** Added per-format "Export current view: <format>" commands sourced from `topbarState.exportActions()` (present only when the active view publishes them). Also split the command cap so search matches the full set (the old hard slice dropped later commands, including export, from search).
- `[x]` **Stamp the export filename** with space + date. Added `buildExportFilename`/`buildExportStem` + `ExportNamingService` (resolves the space name, degrades gracefully). Threaded `{space}-{view}-{YYYY-MM-DD}.{ext}` through timeline (png/pptx/xlsx), bullseye, heatmap, and the catalysts/events/trials/assets/companies grid exports.
- `[x]` **UI-21 (folded): export placement + menu-item icons.** Menu-item file-type icons done (`export-button` maps format → fa-file-image/powerpoint/excel). Placement now normalized: a new `gridToolbarEnd` slot pins `<app-export-button>` to the right of the toolbar on Events/Companies/Assets/Trials/Catalysts, matching the Landscape top-right convention (verified right-aligned in-browser). Search alignment left as-is (Catalysts' end-aligned search is a deliberate accommodation for its wide header block).

### P1.2 — Author identity is broken in the judgment layer
Both personas + **UI-26** (same bug). Positioning is "the platform makes the firm's judgment visible," but judgment is attributed to placeholder garbage. Three surfaces, two root causes (locations re-verified on current `develop`):

1. `[-]` **Intelligence feed byline "BY CLINT".** Resolved as by-design per the agreed decision: the feed byline stays the **firm/agency display name** (`agencyName()` already resolves to `brand.agency.name` → `app_display_name`). "BY CLINT" only appeared because the demo agency is literally named "Clint"; in a whitelabel engagement it resolves to the tenant's agency name (e.g. "Stout"). No code change.
2. `[x]` **Contributors line shows UUID-prefix initials.** Server now returns an `authors` map; `intelligence-block` and `intelligence-history-panel` resolve names from `payload.authors` (with the `authorMap` input as an optional override) via the shared tested `resolveAuthorName`/`resolveContributorLine` helpers. Parents need no wiring — the payload self-describes.
3. `[x]` **Root data gap:** added `resolve_user_display_names(uuid[])` (internal SECURITY DEFINER, revoked from client roles) and threaded an `authors` map through `build_intelligence_payload` and `get_primary_intelligence_history` (migration `20260615120000_intelligence_author_display_names.sql`). Display name = `full_name` → `name` → `email`. Demo bootstrap author seeded with full_name "Daniel Reyes".

**Fix (server-side, preferred):** extend the intelligence RPCs to return a `{user_id: display_name}` map, mirroring the existing `lookup_user_by_email` / marker-history SECURITY DEFINER pattern that already joins `auth.users` (runbook `06-backend-architecture.md:638`). Display name = `auth.users.raw_user_meta_data->>'full_name'` → email local-part fallback. Wire it into all three `authorMap` inputs. Seed demo reads with a plausible analyst name (`20260501130349_extend_seed_demo_intelligence_and_materials.sql`, `_seed_demo_primary_intelligence()` sets `last_edited_by = p_uid` only). **(S–M)**

### P1.3 — Silent permission failures
Both personas lost real time. Both violate the repo's own empty-state audit rules 13.5 (role-appropriate affordances) and 13.6 (never silent).

- `[x]` **(a) Spaces list: no-access card click is a dead no-op.** MD (tenant owner, no `space_members` row) clicked the only card; nothing, repeatedly. `space-list.component.ts:225` `openSpace()` just navigates; `space.guard.ts:30` denies via `has_space_access` and `createUrlTree(['/t', tenantId, 'spaces'])` — redirects to the page you're already on → silent. Access rule is correct by design (firewall, runbook 09); the **silent UX** is the bug. **Fix:** the list should mark accessible vs no-access cards up front (the query knows membership) and either disable with an explanatory tooltip or offer a request/join path; at minimum the guard redirect carries a toast. Relates to **UI-15** (spaces page). **(M)**
- `[x]` **(b) "Add primary intelligence" shown to roles that can't publish.** Analyst (space editor) saw the button, wrote the note, got a 403 with only a tiny "Save failed" label and a silent revert. `upsert_primary_intelligence` gates on `is_agency_member_of_space` and raises `42501` (`20260509130100_intelligence_history_rpcs.sql:34,149,185,232`) — correct by design (intelligence is the agency's deliverable). **Fix:** hide/disable the affordance for non-agency space roles; on any write failure surface a real error toast, not the inline "Save failed" label. **(M)**

### P1.4 — "Live data" story fails on contact (MD's stated pilot blocker)
MD clicked "Sync from CT.gov" (500 from `/api/ctgov/sync-trial`); registry panel shows "(not set)" directly under a header asserting "PH 3".

- `[~]` **Error toast already exists in code.** `trial-detail.component.ts` `syncCtgov()` wraps in try/catch with `messageService.add({severity:'error'})`; `change-event.service.ts triggerSingleTrialSync()` throws on `!res.ok`. The missing toast was almost certainly **the local Worker not running** (no `/api/*` in the bare dev server), not a defect. **Action:** verify with the Worker up; if it fires, no change. If it still swallows, check the post-success `Promise.all([loadTrial, loadSnapshot, loadTrialActivity])` for a throw path bypassing the catch.
- `[x]` **Contradictory phase display is a real UX issue.** Header uses `phase_type || phase` (`trial-detail.component.html:102`); CT.gov panel uses only `phase` (`:363`). Intentionally separate fields (analyst-owned `phase_type` vs CT.gov-synced `phase`), but "PH 3" above "(not set)" reads as a data bug. **Fixed:** CT.gov panel field relabeled "Registry phase (as reported)"; header phase carries a tooltip distinguishing the analyst's assessed phase from the registry phase.

---

## P2 — Workflow blockers + design consistency

### Analyst workflow (persona, single-session but block daily use)
- `[x]` **P2.1 No fuzzy/quarter marker dates.** Added a `markers.date_precision` enum (`exact | month | quarter | half | year`); `event_date` now stores the period MIDPOINT (Q4 2026 -> Nov 15) and the precision records how precise it is. Pure midpoint/label math in `marker-date-precision.ts` (8 specs). The marker form gains a "Date precision" picker that swaps the exact-date input for Year + Quarter/Month/Half selectors and shows the live midpoint. `create_marker` takes `p_date_precision`; `get_dashboard_data` exposes it so the timeline caption ("~Q4 '26"), the marker tooltip ("Q4 2026 (estimated)"), and the Future Catalysts date cell all render the period instead of a false day. Verified in-browser end to end (form + catalyst list). *Deferred follow-ups: the catalyst-detail panel date and the audit/event-title humanization of fuzzy dates still show the midpoint.*
- `[x]` **P2.2 "Projection" field mislabeled.** Options are Stout / Company / Primary / Actual — that's *provenance/source*, not projected-vs-actual. Rename/relabel. **(S)**
- `[x]` **P2.3 Catalyst detail panel has no edit affordance.** Added an "Edit marker" action in the Trial section of the shared marker-detail-content, role-gated (`spaceRole.canEdit()` + a `showEditAction` host opt-in + a parent `trial_id`) so viewers never see it and the events panel (which already has its own marker-edit kebab) shows no duplicate. It navigates to `/manage/trials/:trialId?marker=<id>`, reusing trial-detail's existing inline marker editor + scroll-to-markers. Verified in-browser for an owner.
- `[x]` **P2.4 Intelligence Feed has no compose entry point.** Added a "Publish intelligence" button on the intelligence browse header, gated by `SpaceRoleService.isAgencyMember()` (the same P1.3b `is_agency_member_of_space` gate the entity drawers use, so non-publishers never see it). It opens a compose dialog (Level + filterable entity picker; Engagement anchors to the space) that opens the existing `IntelligenceDrawerComponent` in place against the chosen anchor. Pure entity-option helper + 6 specs. Verified in-browser (button + dialog).
- `[x]` **P2.5 Events row accessible name "View details for null"** despite correct visible titles. **(S)**
- `[x]` **P2.6 Raw enum casing leaks into event titles**, e.g. "Status: RECRUITING→ACTIVE_NOT_RECRUITING". Humanize. **(S)** *Related to UI-29 trials columns.*
- `[x]` **P2.7 Materials page is download-only at page level.** Added a "Register material" action in the materials page toolbar, gated by `SpaceRoleService.canEdit()` (owner/editor, mirroring the per-entity gate; hidden for viewers). It reveals the existing `MaterialUploadZoneComponent` inline (mounted `entityType="space"`, same as engagement-detail), reusing the full register -> R2 -> finalize flow and its embedded linked-entities picker; no new upload path. Empty state upgraded to distinguish filtered vs truly-empty and to be role-appropriate. Verified in-browser (button reveals the zone).

### Design consistency (UI review)
- `[x]` **UI-10 Events table readability.** Title column is now the flex/widest column with an 18rem floor (`w-full min-w-[18rem]`), ellipsizing cleanly instead of cutting mid-word; ENTITY cell is `whitespace-nowrap` so trial codes stay intact. Header sort+filter glyphs no longer wrap (global `data-table th { white-space: nowrap }`).
- `[x]` **UI-12 Heatmap left-panel idiom mismatch.** Unified to one idiom: a shared `app-segmented-control` (connected vertical segments, brand left-accent on the active row) now renders heatmap GROUP BY + COUNT and bullseye GROUP BY, replacing the two divergent hand-rolled controls (stacked chip-buttons vs a horizontal segment, plus a brand-400/600 active-color drift). Vertical because the grouping labels ("Mechanism of Action", "Route of Administration") do not fit a horizontal segment in the 260px panel; per the per-page filter-idiom rule both are small fixed enums, so the segmented idiom is the consistent choice. Component is an accessible radiogroup (roving tabindex, arrow/Home/End via a pure `nextSegmentIndex` helper + spec). Verified in-browser: both panels match, selection still routes (heatmap) / sets state (bullseye). *Custom over PrimeNG SelectButton because the prior controls were already custom and a vertical full-width long-label segment fights the preset; consolidates three hand-rolled controls into one.*
- `[x]` **UI-13 Heatmap labels.** Row labels carry a `pTooltip` with the full text; phase/status column headers (incl. APP/LNCH) carry a `pTooltip` + `aria-label` sourced from `DEVELOPMENT_STATUS_LABELS` (Approved, Launched, ...) so the short forms stay dense but legible.
- `[x]` **UI-14 Bullseye.** Ring labels render after the dots with a slate halo so PH2/PH3 stay legible over the dot band; the center reads "All assets" when unfiltered and "Filtered" only when a bullseye-affecting filter is active (`hasActiveLandscapeFilters`, ignoring the timeline-only Period); "spokes" replaced with the active grouping's noun (`spokeGroupingNoun`, e.g. "12 companies"); Period found to have no effect on the bullseye (the RPC takes no time-period arg) so it is hidden on that view. Pure helpers covered by specs. Verified in-browser. *Targeted fixes only, per the locked decision.*
- `[x]` **UI-15 Spaces page ghost cell.** Empty grid column renders as a gray slab (`gap-px` + `bg-slate-200` hairline technique). Fill empty cells white / dashed "New space" ghost card / cap grid width. *Pairs with P1.3(a).* **(S)**
- `[x]` **UI-16 Super-admin agency rows: bare red trash as the only action.** Delete moved into the shared `app-row-actions` kebab; the existing type-to-confirm dialog now gates via a pure `agencyDeleteConfirmed()` predicate (spec). MAX TENANTS + TENANTS combined into one right-aligned "Tenants" column rendering `used/max` (e.g. 1/5). Verified on the super-admin host: kebab → dialog → Delete enables only on exact-name match; the pre-existing has-tenants guard still blocks.
- `[x]` **UI-17 Members role column treatment mismatch.** The only viewer who sees a mix is an owner (their own row is a badge among dropdowns). Rather than a disabled dropdown (rule 13.5 bans greyed controls), the self row keeps the badge plus a "You" affordance with a tooltip ("You can't change your own role; another owner can."). Applied to both space-members and agency-members. Verified in-browser on space-members. *Color half was already done.*
- `[x]` **UI-18 Agency Branding form.** The `unknown@unknown.invalid` sentinel (written by `provision_agency`) now reads as empty in the form (placeholder `contact@youragency.com`) and is never persisted back (`displayContactEmail`/`normalizeContactEmailForSave` pure helpers + spec). The empty right half now holds a live brand preview (mini header tinted with the chosen brand color + logo via `app-brand-logo` + sample button + hex swatch), wired through `computed()` over the form signals so it updates as you edit; malformed mid-edit hex degrades to teal instead of throwing. *Code-reviewed + unit-tested; not browser-rendered locally (the `/admin/*` agency route is proxied to the Worker, which is not running). Save-disabled half was resolved by UI-6.*
- `[x]` **UI-22 Detail mini-timelines clip phase bars flat at the left edge.** A clipped left edge, or an ongoing (no end date) / past-window right edge, now **opacity-fades** to transparent via an SVG mask (per-bar gradient; `phaseFadeStops` pure helper + spec) so the band visibly dissolves into "continues beyond" instead of a flat cut. A no-end-date phase (which previously rendered nothing, width 0) now runs to the present-day frontier (today) and fades there. *Revised from the first open-stroke attempt, which read as too subtle on thin faint bars (user feedback).* Verified in-browser: 36 bars, 3 masked with solid-core -> transparent-edge stops.
- `[x]` **UI-23 Trial detail header repeats the name** ("ATTAIN-1  ATTAIN-1" when display name == raw name). Suppress the duplicate. **(S)**

## P3 — Polish / first impression

### Persona (MD first-impression)
- `[x]` **P3.1 Shared tenant link lands on a blank shell.** Decision: the authenticated tenant root should route the user in, not show an empty shell or a redundant picker. The tenant root (`/t/:tenantId`) had no empty-path child, so it rendered the app shell with an empty outlet, then required a second "select space" step. Added a redirect guard on a new `path: ''` child (`tenantRootRedirectGuard`, the established `canActivate` + `children: []` always-redirect idiom): exactly one accessible space in the tenant -> straight into it; else the last-opened space if still accessible here; else the real spaces picker (which also carries the no-access state from P1.3a). Rules are a pure `resolveTenantRootTarget` (6 specs); the guard intersects this tenant's non-archived spaces with the caller's explicit membership so cross-tenant access never leaks in. Verified in-browser: the single-engagement demo user opening the bare tenant link now lands directly in Pipeline Demo instead of a blank shell.
- `[ ]` **P3.2 Hero trials drill into empty sections** ("No read yet", "0 reads", "No materials") — uneven demo depth. Demo-data. *Groups with UI-40.* **(S)**
- `[x]` **P3.3 Marker captions still garble at year zoom.** Root cause confirmed in-browser: the start-caption decollision (UI-2) holds, but the range work shipped in stream-2 added a second, **ungated** caption -- the fuzzy end-cap label ("~Q1 '27") rendered at the tail end -- which could land on a neighbour's start caption (the "Majun2626" garble). Fix: brought end-caps into the per-row layout as secondary, width-aware captions. Start captions keep their slots first (unchanged greedy gap, verified non-regressing); end-caps render only when they clear every kept caption by a 3px pad (`placeOptionalCaptions` + `estimateCaptionWidthPx`, mono advance measured at 4.82px/char). New `showEndLabel` input gates the template end-cap; suppressed end labels stay in the tooltip's full range. `markerStartCaption` lifted to the shared pure module (single source of truth for the rendered caption + the width math). 11 new specs. Verified in-browser at year zoom: start captions intact, 3 end-caps render where clear, 0 overlaps.

### UI review polish
- `[x]` **UI-19 Default-host landing is the weakest screen.** Rebuilt as a two-column layout: left = sharpened positioning headline + value line + workspace finder; right = a static, data-free timeline render (`marketing-timeline-preview`, hand-built SVG with phase bars + markers + today line, no network/CLS risk) so the landing shows the instrument. "Go" -> "Open workspace". Verified in-browser on the default host. *Locked decision: static still over live render.*
- `[x]` **UI-20 Command palette polish.** Scrim darkened to slate-900/50 + `backdrop-blur-sm` so the busy timeline recedes; entity rows swap the placeholder color squares for per-kind FontAwesome icons (flask/capsules/building/newspaper/bullseye/terminal) in the kind color; a bottom scroll-fade dissolves the list instead of cutting a row flat; a footer shows keyboard hints (Navigate / Open / Scope / Close). Verified in-browser. **Follow-up (post-merge):** also fixed a pre-existing client/RPC kind mismatch the icon work surfaced -- `search_palette`/`palette_empty_state` emit kind `asset` (renamed from `product` in mig `20260524120500`) but the client `PaletteKind` + icon/color/url maps still used `product`, so asset rows had no icon, no color, and a dead click. Aligned the client to `asset`; verified all six kinds (company/asset/trial/catalyst/event/command) render icons and navigate.
- `[x]` **UI-24 Plural/abbreviation copy glitches.** "1 P3 READOUTS", "1 TRIAL MOVES", "+1 NEW READS"; "12 co" vs "21 assets"; company detail STATS "1 co" (redundant). **(S)**
- `[x]` **UI-26** → folded into **P1.2** (contributors/byline now resolve real display names).
- `[~]` **UI-27 Audit log date format.** Date now renders `MMM d, y, h:mm a` ("Jun 12, 2026, 12:02 AM") and a null actor renders `--` (app convention), in the shared `audit-log-table`. *Apply/Clear left as-is by design:* the audit log is server-queried, so manual apply avoids one request per keystroke — the divergence from auto-apply client lists is intentional.
- `[x]` **UI-28 Catalysts list details.** Generic marker-name titles now surface a trial/asset context subtitle (`catalystContextLine()` pure helper + spec); category cell is `whitespace-nowrap`. The trailing dot was the `app-change-badge` (a real recent-change indicator that already has a tooltip + deep link) — kept by design. *Overlaps P2.3 catalyst panel.*
- `[~]` **UI-29 Trials list columns.** PHASES column was a meaningless `phase_type ? 1 : 0` count reading as a phase number; replaced with a "Phase" column showing the short label (PH 3), sorted in clinical-progression order via `phaseOrder()` (pure helper + spec). Header icons no longer wrap (global th nowrap). *BRIEF TITLE empty is a user-configured CT.gov extra column (data/config, like UI-38/39/40), not a code default — left as-is.*
- `[~]` **UI-30 Companies table layout.** Pagination chrome now only renders when rows exceed one page (`[paginator]="grid.totalRecords() > grid.page().rows"`), applied across all grid tables — so 12-row Companies and 13-row Marker Types show no paginator at the 25-row default. Logo/order columns left as-is (logo inconsistency is intrinsic to source assets).
- `[x]` **UI-31 Marker Types: Trial Start/End glyphs nearly invisible** in the MARKER column. Each glyph now sits in a 28px white swatch with a slate-200 ring (size bumped 18→20), so the faint slate dashed-line markers are locatable and framed consistently with the shape glyphs.
- `[x]` **UI-32 Archived spaces: "Back to spaces" appears three times.** One/two max. **(S)**
- `[x]` **UI-33 Toast placement overlaps header stats** (top-right toast covered the counts on Home). Offset below the page header. *Relates to P1.3/P1.4 error toasts.* **(S)**
- `[x]` **UI-34 DEV badge overlaps content** bottom-right (timeline legend, last catalyst row). Nudge or make dismissible. **(S)**
- `[x]` **UI-35 User menu is sparse.** Decided intent: the menu is for identity + account-level actions that are not part of the working context -- built to that, not padded. Header now carries the avatar (Google picture or initials) + display name (`userDisplayName`: full_name -> name -> email local-part, pure + spec) + email, so it reads as a real account header instead of a bare email. Added a "Help & roles" item -> `help/roles` (the permission model -- the most account-relevant help, always reachable at tenant scope, and exactly what the MD persona who hit access walls wanted; the chrome previously had no help affordance at all). Footer now shows version + current tenant for context. **Deliberately not added: tenant switch** -- it already lives in the topbar tenant dropdown; duplicating a second switcher in the menu would be the padding the brief warns against. No account/profile link because no such page exists (building one is out of scope for the polish tail). Verified in-browser: header renders name+email+avatar, Help item routes to the roles page.
- `[x]` **UI-36 Empty-table chrome.** Pending invites renders full column headers above "No pending invites." Collapse to the message. **(S)**
- `[x]` **UI-37 Asset detail EVENTS double-frames its empty state.** Removed the redundant outer `border` from `entity-events-panel` (it is always embedded as a nested sub-block under the timeline via a `border-t` divider in trial/asset/company detail), tightening all three to one block.

---

## P4 — Stale documentation (verified contradictions)

Migration 75 (`20260429010000_owner_only_explicit_space_access.sql`) removed implicit tenant→space access; `has_space_access` now requires an explicit `space_members` row. Per the docs-no-drift rule, fix in the same change set as related code (ideally alongside P1.3).

- `[x]` **P4.1** `CLAUDE.md:136` — "Tenant members get implicit editor/viewer space access via `has_space_access()`." Stale — correct. Also `tenant_members.role` is now `owner`-only (mig 75); the "`owner | member`" framing is stale too.
- `[x]` **P4.2** `docs/runbook/08-authentication-security.md:94` — "…tenant membership (implicit editor/viewer)…". Stale.
- `[x]` **P4.3** `docs/runbook/11-developer-guide.md:197` — "Tenant members get implicit editor/viewer space access via `has_space_access`" + `owner | member`. Stale.
- `[-]` `docs/runbook/07-database-schema.md:165` (migration-42 row) — historical migration-log entry; leave as history (mig-75 row at :175 records the reversal).

## Data issues surfaced by the UI (fix in data; the UI made them visible)

> **Verified against the local seed (after `supabase db reset`):** the seed is clean — Mounjaro carries only "GIP/GLP-1 dual agonist", there are no intra-space duplicate NCTs, and no "asdf"/"test" strings. All three issues below are therefore **dev-cloud runtime data** entered by hand on dev.clintapp.com, not reproducible from `seed.sql`. They are ops cleanups on the dev database (and any prod demo space), not code changes on this branch.

- `[-]` **UI-38 Duplicate timeline rows.** Not in seed (no intra-space duplicate identifiers). Dev-data dedupe.
- `[-]` **UI-39 Mounjaro MOA wrongly tags "SGLT2 inhibitor".** Not in seed (local Mounjaro is correctly tagged only "GIP/GLP-1 dual agonist"). Dev-data fix: remove the stray `asset_mechanisms_of_action` row on dev.
- `[-]` **UI-40 / P3.2 Test garbage + uneven demo depth.** Not in seed (no garbage strings). Dev-data cleanup: delete the "asdf"/"test"/"Mounjaro!" rows and backfill hero-trial sections on dev.

---

## Suggested execution order (one stream)

1. **P4 docs** — pure text, no risk, unblocks the mental model. (S)
2. **P1.4 phase labeling + P2 small relabels** — P2.2 (Projection), P2.6 (enum humanize), P2.5 (null a11y name), UI-23, UI-24, UI-27. Low-risk polish. (S each)
3. **P1.2 author identity** — RPC display-name map + wire `authorMap` through 3 parents + seed + UI-26 byline decision. (S–M)
4. **P1.1 export** — palette entry + filename stamp + UI-21 placement/icons. (S–M)
5. **P1.3 silent permission failures** — role-aware affordances + real error toasts (+ UI-15 spaces, UI-33 toast offset). (M)
6. **P2.1 fuzzy dates** — model change, larger. (M)
7. **Remaining UI consistency** (UI-10, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 22, 28–37) and **data** (UI-38/39/40, P3.2). Batch by surface.
8. **Decision-gated** — UI-19 landing, UI-20 palette, the three open questions below. Confirm direction first.

## Open questions (need direction before building)

- **P1.2 byline:** firm display-name vs authoring-analyst for the intelligence-feed byline? (Recommend firm for the feed, analyst names on the block.)
- **Filters affordance:** collapse the Landscape filter row into one "Filters" control with applied-filter chips (the READ line already summarizes editorially)?
- **Events/Catalysts:** lead with a one-line READ like Home/Timeline?

## Post-merge follow-ups — stream-2 (2026-06-16)

- `[x]` **Exports respect fuzzy dates + ranges.** The fuzzy-date / range work hadn't touched exports. PNG was already fine (it DOM-captures the live grid, so tails/fuzzy captions come for free). Fixed the data exports, which redraw/emit from data and were showing the false midpoint day: a shared `formatMarkerExtent` (+ `markerEndpointLabel`) pure helper drives the PPTX marker table (`buildMarkerTableRows.date`), the XLSX Markers sheet (Date/End Date are now honest text labels -- "Q4 '26", "onwards" -- not `yyyy-mm-dd` date cells), and the Catalysts CSV/XLSX Date column. Range separator is an en-dash ("Q4 '26 – Q1 '27"). Specs updated + extended (fuzzy/range/onwards cases). Events/trials/asset/company exports unaffected (exact CT.gov dates, not fuzzy markers).

- `[x]` **Marker ranges (P2.1 extension).** Markers were points only; their `end_date` was stored but rendered nowhere. Added true ranges: `end_date_precision` + `is_ongoing` columns (+ `create_marker` params, `get_dashboard_data` fields, a guard so ongoing has no end). The marker form gains an "Extent" control: Point / Until (bounded, with its own fuzzy precision + period pickers, validated end-after-start) / Onwards (open-ended). The timeline renders a tail from the start glyph to a bounded end (with a hollow end cap + `~period` label for a fuzzy end) or fading to the window's right edge for "onwards"; the tooltip shows the extent ("Q4 '26 – Q1 '27", "H2 '26 onwards"). `markerExtentLabel` pure helper + spec. Verified in-browser (bounded fuzzy + ongoing). Covers the user's cases: "approval Q3 2024 onwards", "launched H2 2026 onwards", "readout Q4 2026 to Q1 2027".

- `[x]` **Settings section leaked to non-owners (security/affordance).** The sidebar only filtered the `manage` section for non-editors, so the whole `settings` section (General, Members, Fields, Taxonomies, Marker Types, Audit log) showed to viewers, and only `settings/audit-log` had a route guard. Audit *data* was already safe server-side (RLS `audit_events_select_strict_scope_owners` = space owners only), but the nav/affordance was open. Fix: `filterNavSections` (pure + spec) hides owner-only settings items (General/Members/Fields/Audit log) for non-owners; Marker Types + Taxonomies stay visible (read-only reference). New `spaceOwnerGuard` on `settings/general|members|fields` (audit-log keeps `auditSpaceGuard`); redirects non-owners to the space root with an info toast (matching the P1.3 `space.guard` pattern). Verified: a viewer is redirected from `settings/members`.
- `[x]` **Command palette asset entries broken (UI-20 follow-up).** See UI-20 above -- client kind `product` -> `asset`.

## Locked decisions — stream-2 (2026-06-15)

- **P2.1 fuzzy dates → midpoint + approx marker.** Precision enum `exact | month | quarter | half | year` drives midpoint math; quarter/month/etc. markers render with a hollow ring fill, a `~` prefix on the date caption, and "(estimated)" in tooltip + detail. Point semantics kept everywhere (no range bands). Rejected: range band (structural rendering change, heavy on dense rows), plain midpoint (reproduces the original complaint).
- **UI-19 landing → static product still + copy polish.** A single high-quality static timeline SVG/image as backdrop behind the workspace finder, plus tagline + "Go" button copy polish. Rejected live render: drags in an anon data path on the marketing host, curated demo dataset, and CLS/perf risk on the screen that must load instantly. Static is a clean swap-point if it later goes live.
- **UI-14 bullseye → targeted fixes only.** De-collide ring labels from dots, fix/hide the "Filtered" center label when unfiltered, replace "12 spokes" jargon, clarify/remove Period. No structural redesign (a separate `bullseye-chart-redesign` worktree owns that).
- **UI-22 phase-bar edges → feathered open edge, both sides.** One consistent grammar for "boundary outside/unknown": left edge clipped at viewport → fade-in "starts earlier"; right edge with no end date → fade-out "ongoing" (never a hard cap, which reads as completed). A *projected* end (distinct from null) is the dashed/hollow-to-projected variant, kept separate.

## Verification

```bash
cd src/client && ng lint && ng build
# after any migration change:
supabase db advisors --local --type all
npm run docs:arch        # if migrations / routes / package.json changed
npm run test:units
# integration (export SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY from `supabase status`):
npx vitest run --config integration/vitest.config.ts
```
